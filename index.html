                <h2 class="main-card__subheading">My Background</h2>
                <p class="main-card__text">
                    I'm an MEng Computer Science graduate from the University of Southampton. During my degree, I was able to gain a lot of experience
                    programming using Java, Haskell, and C# - alongside experience in game design and development.
                </p>
                <p class="main-card__text">
                    After I graduated, I was offered the opportunity to complete the
                    <a class="main-card__link" href="https://www.technativedigital.com/tech_finishing_school/">
                        TechNative Digital Tech Finishing School
                    </a>
                    . This was a great opportunity to learn about full-stack web development, as this was something I had not previously studied as
                    part of my degree. I was able to learn about how to build web applications using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - as well as
                    more complex applications using React and Node.js.
